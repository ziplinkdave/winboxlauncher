Scripts and registry files for launching Winbox from Chrome

There are 3 files in this repo: A registry file to import into the registry, a VB script to prevent the powershell window from flashing ( which is annoying ), and a powershell script that parses the URL and calls winbox.exe. I created a folder "Program Files/Winbox" to place both the winbox executable and these files. You can place them wherever you like, but you'll have to edit the scripts accordingly.
